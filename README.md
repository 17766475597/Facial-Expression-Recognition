# Facial-Expression-Recognition
Facial Expression Recognition based on Keras
Environment:
Mac Os
Python 3.6
Keras

This is a small project of facial expression recognition based on the popular deep learning frame-Keras. If you want to train the model, please be sure to run the program on your GPU Server or other high-speed computation tool.

This program may not be compiled directly, becauese of the lack of dataset which is too large to upload. Therefore, please be sure to download to dataset fer2013 from the website before you run the program.
